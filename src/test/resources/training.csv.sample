2017-02-21,10,"Rocketmiles is fact not a fake like the others , when i compare your price with otheres 20 percents differ , and also with nice hotels..."
2017-02-21,10,"For my first experience, I think it is a good oppurtunity for those who travels more like me to earn extra miles and find good hotels. Thank you for concern."
2017-02-21,10,"Hotel was great, thanks to them!"
2017-02-21,9,you should add more hotels and develop your website
2017-02-21,9,"More option in some cities (guatemala and san jose, for example)"
2017-02-21,9,Room rates are bit higher other then agoda or booking.com
2017-02-20,10,I hope you can add more hotels to the list
2017-02-20,9,My stay at The Wharf Inn was terrible (and expensive).  Now I find that I must warn friends to be careful about the places they choose on RocketMiles.
2017-02-20,10,"The hotel was great, the points are fast in receiving, and reliable website!! RocketMiles Thank you!!!!"
2017-02-19,9,The American Airlines Advantage 4000  Miles promos!  Keep 'em comin'!x
2017-02-19,10,Very easy and prices are compatible with regular prices!
2017-02-19,9,Everything was great.  The only time I wouldn't use your service is when I am afraid my plans will change and I don'twant to pay in advance.
2017-02-18,10,Great service over the phone; great on line services
2017-02-18,9,"Screen the quality of the hotels more closely. For example, Sir Francis Drake in San Fran should not be on your list."
2017-02-18,10,Is perfect plataform
2017-02-18,7,Sometimes the hotel does not give you the best rooms if you book through a third oarty
2017-02-18,10,I had an issue with the credit and they fixed that issue promptly and professionally.
2017-02-18,8,"It was frustrating to have my 5 day hotel reservation in Hawaii canceled two hours before my flight.  I arrived with no hotel.  I appreciate you giving me the miles, and hope it does not happen again."
2017-02-17,8,It's not you; it's me.
2017-02-17,10,Great hotel!!!! True to pictures!!
2017-02-17,10,Worked out great! Found a fantastic hotel in Taipei and thoroughly enjoyed the stay.  Won't hesitate to use Rocketmiles again.
2017-02-17,10,View things: You have to add more icons for our choises like i want to rent suite or choose free parking or wifi or water front hotel add view buttones please Thanks
2017-02-17,0,"Basically, stop lying.  You sent me an email that you accredited me 9,000 miles for a purchase and you never did.  You are no more than a bunch of liars and I will never recommend you nor use you again. And be thankful I don't denounce you for fraud."
2017-02-17,10,"As a new mileage lifestyle man, I appreciate the opportunity to earn extra miles any chance I get!  Your site and services were easy to access."
2017-02-17,9,"Overall things were very good.  A bit of confusion with room types when looking on the Rocketmiles website (I believe the two queen beds room was listed as two twin's).  It might be worth a quick review to align room types on Rockermiles website with room types on the hotels websites.  Other than that, things were good.  Thank you!  We will definitively use rocketmiles again."
2017-02-17,10,"Wish I had known of this before or the service had existed before. Not only the awards, the response is also amazing."
2017-02-16,10,nice new hotel. Bed is extremely comfortable. Breakfast was good and no complaints at all.
2017-02-16,10,I LOVE Rocketmiles!
2017-02-16,10,Easy booking. Real miles. They accumulate quickly. Best program ever. Thanks.
2017-02-16,0,"In a airport emergency, when the plane couldn't be flown for engine problems and we had to be rerouted, we were not able to cancel our reservation. This is unexceptabke and we will not use your service again nor recommend it to anyone. Very unfortunate your rules not your customer service aren't flexible for an emergency that effected 270 passengers."
2017-02-16,10,"I introduced Rocketmiles to my friend but he can't find ANA mileage. If ANA is available, many Japanese people will use Rocketmiles."
2017-02-16,8,Don't send that many emails!!!!
2017-02-16,8,Rocket miles is really awesome.  But any hotels are missing the list.
2017-02-16,8,More selections
2017-02-16,7,Room small. Hilton gives me my perks for being a high level member- this hotel did not!!
2017-02-16,10,"Of course, when you do a customer survey, at the point of receiving the miles in your account, I would be very likely to offer strong praise:)"
2017-02-16,10,I had some problems with the front desk but RocketMiles worked with me and got it fixed. I appreciated their patience and persistence.
2017-02-16,10,"Very easy to work with, not one problem.  Thank you!"
2017-02-16,10,"While the room prices may be nominally lower than Rocketmiles, at times, with discounts, nothing beats the air miles."
2017-02-16,10,cabañas con excelente mantenimiento y cuidado
2017-02-16,10,Love Rocketmiles!!  I keep checking before I book a room the rooms change all of the time and so do the milage bonuses.
2017-02-16,10,Easy and convenient to use. Thanks.
2017-02-16,8,"Not enough hotel options. I wanted to stay in Greeley, CO, but the closest hotel you could offer me was 20 miles away in Loveland, CO. On the same night I stayed with you in Loveland, Expedia was listing 12 different available hotels in Greeley."
2017-02-16,9,2 improvements... -A short cancellation window and -If Amazon gift cards could be linked directly to my Amazon acct Then working w Rocketmiles would be Perfect!
2017-02-16,5,This is the 3rd time I have booked with Rocket Miles to show and find out the place I'm staying at has some type of renovation going on.  Not good.
2017-02-16,10,Your customer service is very good and I appreciated your quick response to my question.
2017-02-16,10,Love earning air miles at this rate!
2017-02-16,10,Always very helpful
2017-02-16,8,"solo que chequen bien las condiciones de pago, tuve un pequeño problema ya que me habían cobrado por adelantado y el hotel no acepto y hasta que llegue me avisaron."
2017-02-16,10,Virgin rocketmiles website is very good and easy to use. Great idea.
2017-02-15,10,Easy to use and fast credit of mileage
2017-02-15,7,"Provide more miles  "
2017-02-15,8,very pleased
2017-02-15,0,"La mayoría de las personas en México, que contratamos el servicio de Hoteles, requerimos factura fiscal y por este medio no existe!!"
2017-02-15,10,I tell every traveler that I meet about Rocketmiles! :)
2017-02-15,10,Not
2017-02-14,7,More properties to choose from please.
2017-02-14,8,Turn the refrigerator on so it is at operating temperature long before we are scheduled to arrive.
2017-02-14,6,My favority website for hotels is booking.com and when I search here I dont see the same amount of hotels that booking.com has for the same destinations. I lobe the ideao of earning miles but I find just few options.
2017-02-14,10,It was an easy process to make miles.
2017-02-14,7,I was not given the option of paying taxes were my associate didnt pay tax.
2017-02-14,3,Your prices are than expedia
2017-02-14,0,"i asked for the bill last week, but noone return to me.."
2017-02-14,6,"The price! For example, I've just booked the Kings Arms in Sandwich, UK for 16th Feb for £76.50 through Booking.com. With you, it was £85. Also - and this is very annoying - it is never clear whether or not breakfast is included or not with your system."
2017-02-14,10,"The best way to travel and book hotels. Even though there might be a slight premium, overall with the miles collected its very well worth it."
2017-02-14,8,More miles will be better
2017-02-14,10,Great !!! :) YOu travel and you earn miles for your next trip !!
2017-02-14,10,Thanks for all
2017-02-14,3,"The hotel asked me for a fee they called ""service charge"" which should be included in the rooms rate as the email received from you ""the room was prepaid in full"" so why I had to pay extra?"
2017-02-14,5,Miles received. Hotel points were not received or expected; however I thought we might get credit for a stay or night which we did not.
2017-02-14,8,Make a broader selection of hotels available.
2017-02-13,6,I would recommend it to friends who are active Avios earners - but not all my friends are - and in some destinations the choice of hotels is a bit limited.
2017-02-13,10,Nice and clean hotel.   Easy commute to downtown with buses
2017-02-13,5,I just found the hotel at a much cheaper price after buying from you.
2017-02-13,10,Great concept. Beautifully executed. Amazing human support when needed. Thanks Rocketmiles!
2017-02-12,2,"Not enough hotels, so dificult to pay, not options to pay at the hotel, the price is better in other search apps"
2017-02-11,10,Great hotels and you get an unbelievable amount of miles WHAT A GREAT DEAL                                               Fred
2017-02-11,10,Excelente !!!
2017-02-11,7,More competitive price.
2017-02-11,10,Most of the fares are non refundable and the room details are not there and no pictures if the hotel nor the rooms are available !!!
2017-02-11,10,Great program.
2017-02-10,10,Easy booking - would use again !
2017-02-10,9,just fine
2017-02-10,8,"More hotels (especially boutique hotels and inns)! Also, pricing on Rocketmiles tends to be on the higher end, meaning I generally only use it to book business travel, which I do much less frequently than personal travel."
2017-02-10,10,I like Mongers for changing travel plans
2017-02-10,9,I accidentally pushed a lower button than a 10!    Darn small screens on phones.
2017-02-10,10,Certificado good!
2017-02-10,9,More points and more hotels to choose from!
2017-02-10,10,Great service and super fast posting the mile/points.
2017-02-10,10,Customer service is very quick and helpful!
2017-02-09,8,any promotion about extra miles
2017-02-09,6,It seemed like the hotel was overpriced.
2017-02-09,2,Well the rates are high in some cases--to pay for the extra miles.  I said that before and you said NO but in this case it was.  Plus your computers dont accept real airline freq flyer numbers..someone has to have mine fixed somehow....I have a mix of numbers and letters and rocket mail said that isnt correct...well it is correct and the miles got in thank goodnes. However too much hassle to ever recommend to anyone else.
2017-02-09,8,Lower prices.
2017-02-09,10,Nice clean and has a bar
2017-02-09,2,price was not as advertised
2017-02-09,10,"Got the hotel I wanted earned 5,000 points, it's all good!!"
2017-02-09,10,thanks
2017-02-09,3,You charged me $50.00 more than my hotel bill was! My phone number is 901-594-5190 should you want to explain this to me..
2017-02-09,9,Keep up the reward miles
2017-02-09,10,I was happy with the miles! Booking process ran smoothly and everything was fine at the stay.
2017-02-09,0,The
2017-02-09,10,You are just the best.
2017-02-09,7,Comparable prices
2017-02-09,8,is necesary more offers the hotels
2017-02-09,10,Great program.  It is also very useful for hotels which do not have a program.
2017-02-09,7,o site nao permite ver as fotos dos quartos dos hoteis e nao diz se e luxo standard ou suite...so muda o preco mas nao relata
2017-02-09,4,"Two points about my recent reservation: 1) I booked two nights at separate times. I contacted the concierge to see if you could combine these and I was told you would work with the hotel to combine them into a single reservation, but when we arrived at the hotel that had not been done. Fortunately, the hotel was able to accommodate us, but it was frustrating that this was not avoided before check in.   2) I needed a riom with two Beds, but again, this could not be arranged beforehand and led to an embarrassing situation at the hotel. Again, the hotel was able to accommodate us. But in the future, I would probably not use Rocketmiles unless travelling alone to avoid a situation like this.   Thanks, Chris."
2017-02-09,8,Nothing!
2017-02-09,10,Great program
2017-02-09,10,Great reservation site!
2017-02-09,10,"Very easy to use when booking travel, great way to pad the loyalty points."
2017-02-09,9,"We did find that some of the hotels on Rocketmiles were more expensive than other sites.  We were happy to pay a bit more since we were getting the bonus miles, but I probably won't use it often because I would rather use other sites to get a lower price on travel."
2017-02-09,9,I would like to know EXACTLY what room I have booked.
2017-02-09,10,Easy booking
2017-02-09,10,It was an easy process!
2017-02-09,5,"As Rocketmiles begins attracting customers...as is everyone else it seems, the incentives (mpd(miles per dollars spent)) should be greater, even double that which you currently advertise). The hotel prices are not discounted..."
2017-02-09,5,"I like the idea, the extra miles are great. The hotel was slightly more expensive than if booking through the website directly. The hotel quality was not up to par as there were cockaroaches in our bathroom."
2017-02-09,10,I have trouble with booking rocketmiles often online because it says that the one that I selected is no longer available.
2017-02-09,8,As a business traveler I am little reluctant to make non-refundable payments for lodging on business trips.
2017-02-09,10,Una aplicación muy buena la recomiendo 100%
2017-02-09,6,Make it easier to search for available hotels. The needs to be an option to choose how many miles within a certain place to search.
2017-02-09,10,hTrt'nsawletoHtsa
2017-02-09,8,"As provided in other emails, we've had issues with the advertisement of higher rewarded miles for different hotels/room selection, but then when attempting to book, all of a sudden the miles have changed (i.e.: 4,000 miles--goes down to 1,000). Often times we specifically use Rocketmiles to build points, and while we're still building points, it's a little discouraging.  One a more positive note, Rocketmiles was very receptive to our feedback in a previous email, and compensated us with additional miles and an explanation of room availability to go along with the miles once the system reaches out to find the room.  While we definitely appreciated the gesture and it helped preserve our desire to continue using Rocketmiles, it would be nice to have more consistency while booking--if that's possible."
2017-02-09,8,Thought the hotel pricing was high but I guess if you want miles you have to pay for them one way or another.
2017-02-09,10,"Although the hotel seemed reasonably quiet we had the smallest room I've ever had in that hotel and I've stayed there many times before. The one reserved for the cheap payers, right by the lift shaft!"
2017-02-09,9,More hotels.  The selection in Alaska is usually really small.
2017-02-09,9,"Sometimes, after filling all details, the app shows hotel not available any longer at original offer of miles or price.  You need to fix it. There should be more options immediately available even if original hotel offer has changed."
2017-02-09,10,Gracias todo muy bien..
2017-02-09,9,GOOD JOB!
2017-02-08,10,Great services
2017-02-08,10,Sehr gut! Top?
2017-02-08,6,Jehehsh
2017-02-08,8,More choices of room types. I would like a king size bed.
2017-02-08,7,Send fax to golden tulip Hael because the email is not enough that I used to make my reservation late and the employees of the reservation of the hotel leave work early So that the receptionist refused to let me enter the room without giving him cash money or details of the my MasterCard
2017-02-08,10,This website is the best partner airline rewards site I've found. Thank you!
2017-02-08,10,Great idea to make hotel stays count on your flightrewards
2017-02-08,10,very good
2017-02-07,10,I love all the Southwest rewards I earn booking hotels through Rocketmiles!
2017-02-07,10,thx
2017-02-07,4,you should avoid the reservation chancelletions and last minute onside payments. If you canchel a reservation; you should solve the issue or find better options for your customers. more respect to customers!
2017-02-07,7,"Hi - this time rocket miles and my reservation worked perfectly. But the time right before this I arrived at the hotel and they claimed the reservation had been made but not paid for (Rocket miles had already charged my card) and that because it hadn't been paid for, they had released my room to another customer. I was with a big group and was embarrassed to have this problem. Eventually it got resolved but it took three days and multiple trips to the hotel front desk and calls to Rocket Miles. Hotel was Best Western Inn Towner in Madison WI."
2017-02-07,9,Great as usual! My goto place for NYC....
2017-02-07,10,"Selection was good making reservation was easy, website was easy to navigate. More clarity on parking expenses would be appreciated."
2017-02-07,7,Would like to know when bonus miles will post to the account. Doesn't mention them in the email.
2017-02-07,10,Great way to earn miles
2017-02-07,10,Easiest site to use!!
2017-02-05,10,"Muy buen servicio, cumple lo que promete!!!"
2017-02-04,10,top top top!!!!!
2017-02-04,9,"I may have missed it, but price of parking was more expensive than I had imagined. If that kind of information could be provided under hotel info it would be helpful.  Thanks for everything!"
2017-02-04,10,Love Rocket!!
2017-02-04,10,Easy to navigate website.
2017-02-04,7,"Stop the bait and switch. i can look several times at the site and the amount of miles doesn't change (even after refreshing) and then the INSTANT that I go to book the room, it comes up as ""Oh that's not available anymore, but we have it now for 2000 or 3000 miles less"". Happens EVERY time and gets very annoying and frustrating. Made all the more insulting when you're told ""our offers are constantly changing"", when that's clearly not the case. It's a little too coincidental that EVERY time I go to actual book the room, hundreds of other people are booking at that exact second and so the offer disappears. It is very ""bait and switch"" and very annoying. It discourages me from using the site."
2017-02-03,8,8
2017-02-03,9,Good
2017-02-03,10,Keep the aeroplan miles coming!
2017-02-03,10,"If you could compare 2 reward programs in 1 search, that would be beneficial."
2017-02-02,8,Nothing it was easy but I called in advance to hotel before I pushed the button as I was not confident if I paid for a room on your website that there really was a room at the hotel. Next time I'll feel better about it.
2017-02-02,10,It was very easy to use rocket miles!
2017-02-02,10,My friends and I love to use rocket miles!
2017-02-02,7,I felt your price quote was misleading.  Include taxes in your price quote before the booking page.
2017-02-02,10,I like RocketMiles and recommend it to friends all of the time.
2017-02-02,10,Glad I found you..
2017-02-02,9,Sometimes no offers in locations I need.
2017-02-02,5,"I liked the fact that Rockey Travel informed the hotel of all my requests , but a price wise it was a rip off- i paid $240 for a $170 room ( that is what i got a credit for) and then paid taxes on a top of it. Could have saved at least $70 and get a free vallet parking ($20) if booked through the hotel website."
2017-02-02,8,more hotels in new areas
2017-02-02,10,Best way to earn miles by far. Even more than the flight.
2017-02-02,10,There needs to be an option for adding children when booking. Hotels charge more for extra people but not usually children and I don't want to put 4 people in the search because it will give a rate of 4 adults where if I put 2 adults and 2 children the rate is lower through the actual hotel site.
2017-02-02,9,referral program should be easier as I referred to several friends but the link was hard to use for them.
2017-02-02,10,An easy way to earn miles!
2017-02-02,8,More options that are still affordable with higher nightly mileage awards
2017-02-02,10,"Please ensure that your prices are more in line with the hotels regular price. ROcketmiles is very high, and does not include breakfast, etc., which the hotel offers its clients directly.  I would appreciate it if you would verify the quality of the hotels you recommend .  Lately, it's lacking."
2017-02-01,10,Very well done.
2017-01-31,6,When using mobile application meals do not appear whether included or not.  Please add this to the application
2017-01-31,8,Not every hotels are listed
2017-01-31,10,While making reservations smoothly earning airmiles is fantastic.
2017-01-31,10,Wonderful program and user friendly also.
2017-01-31,10,Please increase your hotel agreements since there are some hotels available in other web sites like booking and I couldn't find it in your site as haus piesendorf in austria
2017-01-31,8,Please add more hotels
2017-01-31,10,thank you
2017-01-31,10,There's no much hotel  Must increase hotels
2017-01-31,10,Great way to earn miles for a trip
2017-01-31,10,IT WORKS VERY WELL. I AM HAPPY WITH RKM
2017-01-31,10,Prices are more competitive than they were when rocketmiles launched and points are normally higher than competitor website
2017-01-31,8,good
2017-01-31,10,"Continue adding more locations and hotels to be selected for accommodation. Also mention if a good eatery / pub / transit system pickup is with the location of hotel , when giving information on hotel for selection."
2017-01-31,10,"Adding royal thailand airline miles and emirates skywards will be great, many of my friends don't use rockets miles becuz of this reason. Best, rashid"
2017-01-31,10,Love the service. Just need more options and more of the reservations should be refundable.
2017-01-31,7,"Se recomienda poder pagar en cuotas sin intereses / have the opportunity to paid in parts with a credit card  (without interest). ot only in one payment (without interest).    Please it is important to search by the name of the hotel not only by the place.   It is important to put the name of the hotel that I earn the point, not only the point assigned. I could not check the points  obtained in each hotel,  Thank you"
2017-01-31,10,Works smoothly and quickly.  I recommend
2017-01-30,0,Invoice can't be recognized by the company...
2017-01-30,8,We got stuck ina room at the end of a hall as far away from the desk as possible.  we were even put in an older building.  It was evident there were rooms available in the newest building.
2017-01-30,10,love earning lots of miles and staying in great hotels!
2017-01-29,4,Very embarrassing after my first booking and upon arrival at the hotel they couldn't obtain their payment from the card they were given. I called and concierge said they would take care of it but hotel expressed their displeasure in dealing with this 3rd party.
2017-01-29,9,Many of your telephone agents can be surprsingly surly and curt to customers. I called in a couple of times with questions and was pretty sure the answer I was given was wrong (and it eventually I realize it was indeed). So it was disappointing that they were rude and wrong as well. Customer service needs improvement
2017-01-28,9,More options with 3k plus points/miles can be earned
2017-01-28,10,easy to book. Lots of choices.
2017-01-28,6,Lower prices
2017-01-28,10,Was very happy with the concierge service.
2017-01-28,9,Credit bonus miles in timely manner.
2017-01-28,10,RM Concierge: very kind and professional. A real back office.
2017-01-28,5,Do not recommend.
2017-01-27,5,2 booking.com with each 1000 miles bonus. Got only 1 confirmation
2017-01-27,10,"Would have been nice if fees were included in my initial payment, but I like the website and concept.  Works for me"
2017-01-27,8,"Help me to right in My countrys vat, or at least give me the opportunity to right IT in on the receipt.  Best regards,  Mike"
2017-01-27,7,Necesitan mejorar su plataforma de reservaciones en linea. Inicialmente quize realizar mi reservacion un dia sabado y a pesar de realizar todo el proceso incluso desde maquinas diferentes esta nunca fue exitosa porque enviaba un mensaje de error. Despues al intentar comunicarme via telefonica resulto que solo atienden de lunes a viernes. Asi que hable al siguiente lunes y finalmente pude realizar la reservacion. Ademas de esto la plataforma en internet necesita ser mas amigable y darte mas informacion de los hoteles para encontrar tu mejor opcion.
2017-01-27,10,"My experiences have been very good, thus far. I have already referred you to several people. I regret that they didn't use my name so I could get credit for it but that's alright. I will try to get future referrals to use my name."
2017-01-27,7,More hotels to chose from
2017-01-26,0,The double-occupancy room for two adults that you booked for me had only a full-size bed.  That is not acceptable for two adults.
2017-01-26,9,Awesome experience - thanks!!
2017-01-26,10,Rocketmiles is out of this world!
2017-01-26,10,Great service
2017-01-26,10,"The program is great!!!. However, I would like it if my receipt for mileage redeemed have my booking number on it."
2017-01-26,8,It took several attempts to actually book a room. I received a number of timeout errors that caused me to have to restart the process. If everything worked smoothly I would have rated the app and process higher.
2017-01-26,3,Don't charge a premium for the rooms. I found that directly on the IHG website I could have saved $50 / night had I reserved the room directly and not through rocket miles
2017-01-26,10,It was a bonus to receive avios too.
2017-01-26,10,Including resort fees in hotel prices would be very helpful.
2017-01-26,9,not pay upfront
2017-01-26,9,Rocketmiles was a great find on the internet.  Not only do I get a great stay but I also get rewarded to use them with airline miles.  The only thing I would like to see different is more options.  Rocketmiles doesn't have the best options but the ones they do have are great choices.
2017-01-26,9,Nothing  - great company; innovative; fresh; wonderful value.  Just leaving room for perfection!
2017-01-26,8,Doing a great Job!!!
2017-01-26,5,The place I regularly stay is no longer on your list.  Talk about bait and switch!
2017-01-26,10,"Great program, easy to use, love the miles!"
2017-01-26,8,"prices are a little expensive when compared to hotel.com, expedia etc"
2017-01-26,6,"1. I think the prices with Rocketmiles is more expensive than expedia, tripadvisor, hotels.com, etc. Only folks into their rewards program would probably use this service. Those who want the best price shouldn't go through Rocketmiles."
2017-01-26,7,It would be helpful to really highlight that the cancellation policy is different than if you reserved directly through the hotel.
2017-01-26,10,Excellent opportunity again.  Thanks
2017-01-26,3,I researched price options from rocket miles vs. the point advantage of my hotel loyalty program and in most cases I am better served within my hotel loyalty program
2017-01-26,8,Expand range of hotels
2017-01-26,10,Miles attractive
2017-01-26,7,"Stay was fine, but, I'm angry w/AA for posting 12,500 mile flights then charging 20,000!"
2017-01-26,10,"It would be great to have opportunity to book different room types at the properties, understanding that they would be at different price levels.  But if traveling solo, as I usually do for work, then the current service is fine...and I LOVE the miles!:)"
2017-01-26,0,"Paguei a reserva no Brasil para não ter problemas, e a mesma foi estornada.  Quer dizer, ainda não verifiquei o cartão de crédito  O valor pago no Japão, não sei se está correto, perguntei e não me responderam se a equivalência está certa.  Acho que não, mas não consigo verificar no momento.  Ainda estou em viagem"
2017-01-26,10,"Easy to use, excellent customer service, you should try."
2017-01-26,9,My details were not provided to the hotel
2017-01-26,9,"Was impressed with thoroughness of reservation preference request and confirmation follow up.  If miles have indeed been already transferred to my account, I'm quite pleased with this experience."
2017-01-26,10,Hhhh
2017-01-26,8,I would like to be able to add my loyalty hotel brand also
2017-01-26,10,More hotel options would be great
2017-01-26,10,LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!!!  You are feeding my miles addiction!
2017-01-26,9,"It can be really frustrating to spend time looking for a hotel, choosing it and then, when you go to pay, it says the offer is no longer offered ( or words to that effect. ) Should  eliminate hotels from the option list immediately upon the offer being withdrawn, so time isn't wasted. Otherwise, you are doing a great job. Mike"
2017-01-26,10,The choise of hotels was not very large
2017-01-25,10,"Great site, used it 4 times and no problems at all. The jetblue points are a great incentive."
2017-01-25,10,Start getting more hotels in Africa Our office will utilize
2017-01-25,10,Really easy to book
2017-01-25,8,Look for specific hotel and not just the place where you need the hotel
2017-01-25,10,Great service and room description was accurate! best way to earn miles!!!
2017-01-25,8,I felt very happy using Rocketmiles and everything in the hotel I booked was satisfactory. I will recommend.

2017-01-25,10,"Easy to locate and find hotels with the map, and see the prices and how mant Cashpoints you earn for your stay. Also a very functional, modern and easy. Very happy."

2017-01-24,9,Provide more Hilton options.
2017-01-24,10,More hotel options would be great.
2017-01-24,8,"It's a great concept, and while I enjoyed my trip, I wish you had more hotel options, as mine was not exactly in the most desired location of Pompano Beach."
2017-01-24,10,Great customer service
2017-01-24,10,Quick way to boost my miles.
2017-01-24,10,:)
